With a central interest in using and improving computational methods, high-performance computing and optimization to aid in the solution of engineering problems, we focus on problems related to fluid dynamics, fluid-structure interaction and energy efficiency. We actively use and participate in the development of open source tools to support our research and consulting activities.  

I'm fascinated by the use of advanced technology to solve the problems of society.
